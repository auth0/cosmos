          <Text>
            Code (components, tokens, etc.) and design assets (sketch files, icons, etc.) should
            always have the same naming convention/API and be kept in sync. The documentation is the
            tool to help bridge the gap between design, engineering and product.
          </Text>

          <Heading2>Encourage the best UX/UI practices</Heading2>
          <Text>
            We should provide guidelines on when to use components and patterns (or not) to ensure
            consistency throughout our products (and within).
          </Text>

          <Heading2>Have meaningful defaults, bake convention in the components</Heading2>
          <Text>
            Developers should be able to pick a component create the recommended design guideline
            out of the box. Optimise for ease of implementation. Bonus: Challenge conventions all
            the time.
          </Text>

          <Heading2>
            Provide powerful abstractions while exposing the inner components at the same time
          </Heading2>
          <Text>
            It should be easy + fast to build entire pages with cosmos, but at no point should the
            developer feel limited by the system. If there's a need to go out of the recommended
            way, they should be able to compose it with the inner/base components.

          <Heading2>Be open about progress, direction, intentions</Heading2>
