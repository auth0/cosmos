# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Currently, this project is using an `0.x` versioning system to indicate its preview status. As such, it does _not_ currently adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Once we reach production readiness, we will follow semver beginning with our `1.0` release. In the meantime, please read this changelog for information on breaking changes!

## 0.12.2 [January 9, 2019]

### Fixed

- Icon: Add ‚Äúapplication‚Äù icon. [#1401]
- Alternate implementation for uniqueId: This improves snapshot testing experience by removing random hashes from components attributes. [#1374] (Warning: You may need to update some snapshots and remove any uniqueId mock.)
- Breadcrumb: Fix automation attribute naming. [#1309] (Warning: You may need to update some tests.)

**Breadcrumb change**

We have renamed the Breadcrumb.Link automation attribute from this:
`<a data-cosmos-key="link">clicky</a>`
to this:
`<a data-cosmos-key="breadcrumb.link">clicky</a>`

Please update your tests (if any) accordingly.

**UniqueId helper change**

In the past, we used to randomly generate an id for some attributes that were required to link components.
Now we're using a global counter, which will lead to improve snapshot testing since each test is run in an isolated environment, and then each test run will have a fresh and pure start.

If you were using a mock for `uniqueId` as a workaround:

```js
jest.mock('../../../core/components/_helpers/uniqueId', () => () => 'abcdef1234')
```

Please, remove it since is no longer needed.
