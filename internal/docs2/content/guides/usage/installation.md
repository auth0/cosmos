To add cosmos to your react application, run

```shell
$ yarn add @auth0/cosmos
```

If you prefer npm, run this command instead:

```shell
$ npm install --save @auth0/cosmos
```

That is all you need to do, you are now ready to use it in your app, no build step needed.

Cosmos assumes you have licensed fonts available on your app: Fakt-web and Roboto Mono. Auth0 employees can grab these from the [cosmos-fonts repo](https://github.com/auth0/cosmos-fonts)
