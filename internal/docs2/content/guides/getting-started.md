# Getting Started

###### Cosmos is a Design System to build Auth0 products.

## Installation

To add `cosmos` to your react application, run

```shell
    $ yarn add @auth0/cosmos
```

If you prefer npm, run this command instead:

```shell
    $ npm install --save @auth0/cosmos
```

That is all you need to do, you are now ready to use it in your app, no build step needed.

Continue to the [usage section](/usage) to read more.

## Examples

We have created some applications with cosmos:

[PoC of manage](/?url=manage/#/clients)

[Overview of components](/overview)

[Hello world](https://github.com/auth0/cosmos/tree/master/examples/webpack-hello-world)

## Feedback
