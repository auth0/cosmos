# Guiding principles

###### The aim of Cosmos is to help **designers** and **developers** deliver work faster and better.

## Common language for all teams

Code (components, tokens, etc.) and design assets (ui kits, icons, etc.) should always have the same naming convention/API and be kept in sync. The documentation is the tool to help bridge the gap between design, engineering and product.

## Encourage the best UX/UI practices

We should provide guidelines on when to use components and patterns (or not) to ensure consistency throughout our products (and within).

## Have meaningful defaults, bake convention in the components

Developers should be able to pick a component create the recommended design guideline out of the box. Optimise for ease of implementation. Bonus: Challenge conventions all the time.

## Provide powerful abstractions while exposing the inner components at the same time

It should be easy + fast to build entire pages with cosmos, but at no point should the developer feel limited by the system. If there's a need to go out of the recommended way, they should be able to compose it with the inner/base components.

## Be open about progress, direction, intentions
