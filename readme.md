> “Set of shared and integrated principles and patterns that define the overall design of a product.” — Karri Saarinen @ Airbnb

&nbsp;

There are 4 big parts of Cosmos:

* Tokens: _configs_ that can be shared imported into projects
* Components: React component library
* Overview: Bird's eye view of components
* Styleguide: Documentation of the design system

&nbsp;

In its current shape, this repository is a create-react-app project.

The `src` folder has all of the code, while `assets` has our design files.

If you peek under `src`, you will find 3 big folders. As we build our library, these folders can directly import code from each other. However, in the final structure, `tokens` and `components` will be consumable as npm packages.
