## Icon Library

You can see the available icons here. To find a specific icon, type in a search string
in the box below, and the list will be filtered. You can also find the canonical name
for icons by searching for words with similar meaning; for example, if you search for
`trash` or `remove`, the `delete` icon will be displayed.

<Alert icon="megaphone" title="Hot tip!" type="information" dismissible={false}>
  If you are migrating icons from Styleguide, input the icon number in the search field to find the corresponding name. It will save you a lot of time!
